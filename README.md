Dribble:  1. I liked this particular product because of its appearance, the color scheme is chosen quite well, the backgrounds in the pictures are also well-chosen, the logo has a minimalist style. The top panel is done well, for the shortcomings, I would change the font to a bolder one. (https://dribbble.com/shots/21304673-PixelGoods-Website)
