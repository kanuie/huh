# Examples of Good Websites for Web Designers
Dribble:

1. I liked this particular product because of its appearance, the color scheme is chosen quite well, the backgrounds in the pictures are also well-chosen, the logo has a minimalist style. The top panel is done well, for the shortcomings, I would change the font to a bolder one. (https://dribbble.com/shots/21304673-PixelGoods-Website)
2. Also, a pretty good site, I liked the panel on the right the most, the main goals are located in a prominent place. (https://dribbble.com/shots/21307183-Synthexis-Software-Scanning-App)
3. Very, very cool icons at the bottom, I like that everything is rounded, the color scheme is great, the only thing I would remove is the background noise. (https://dribbble.com/shots/21305333-Podcast-Platform-Landing-Page-UI)
